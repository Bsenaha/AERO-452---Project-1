===== MISSION ITINERARY =====

* Begin at 100km orbit lower than target orbit
    - this will give slight relative deltav to get us to first holding range

* Reach 40km and perform first hold
    - no burn required, cruise during this hold from 40km to 20km (or as close as possible)

* Perform Burn 1 to reach 1km relative distance in FRONT of target 

* Perform second hold

* Perform Vbar approach hop from 1km to 300m holding position

* Perform third hold

* Perform final Vbar approach burn to final holding position

* Perform final hold until Mission Duration reached
